# Startup-VC-Connections
Work-in-progress code examining how similarities in educational background, ethnicity, and cultural values between start-up entrepreneurs and the investor principals that fund the start-ups relate to the probability of start-up funding and exits.

Preliminary results show that these similarities are associated with a up to 300% increase in the odds of the start-ups with personnel that have their similarities with the funding organisation (fund) obtaining funding compared to a start-up whose personnel do not, and a up to 35% lower odds of exiting within 5 to 7 years after the first round of funding.
